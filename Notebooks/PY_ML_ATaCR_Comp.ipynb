    "# MATLAB vs Python Versions of ATaCR\n",
    "\n",
    "--- ALL DIFFERENCES FOUND::\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. --------------Filtering disagreement during event correction--------------\n",
    "    \t1. A lowpass filter & taper is performed on the transfer functions in b4_CorrectEvent that is not present anywhere in the Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. --------------Averaging choice for deriving TFs--------------\n",
    "    \t1. By default, both codes use the transfer functions made from the DAY AVERAGE preceding the event time.\n",
    "    \t\t1. That said, the pre-event time window that determines this TF selection is very slightly different in the two codes. The ML version requires both start and end times of the TF to preceed the event. The python version only requires the start time to be before the event (ie the event occurs WITHIN the TF window).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. --------------Choosing the pre-event TF--------------\n",
    "    \t1. Unlike the Matlab version, there is nothing in the Python code to stop individual trace data (SAC files) to be less than an entire day of recording. Thus an edge case exist when querying times from IRIS to yield hour long traces (ie many deployments retain SAC files in hour resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. --------------Tilt Searching for H--------------\n",
    "    \t1. Both codes use the same tilt frequency range ([.005, .035]) when determining maximum coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. --------------Filter differences--------------\n",
    "    \t1. In the Python version, station spectra at every level of processing (ie quality control at lines 232 and 276 of atacr_clean_spectra and atacr_clean_spectra, respectively) has a SIGNIFICANTLY higher corner ([0.004 2.0] Hz) than the Matlab version ([0.004 0.2] Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. --------------Hanning Taper Inconsistency--------------\n",
    "    \t1. The hanning taper appears to be twice as long in the Matlab version compared to Python's version. Admittedly, its possible ML's hanning might operate differently than Numpy's, hanning(2x_num_pts_to_overlap), but I would doubt it based on the documentation for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. --------------Inconsistencies in power spectra station averages--------------\n",
    "    \t1. While they are station averages and not used for deriving the TFs (by default), their is marked inconsistencies in power and fq when comparing the two code outputs. As stated above, the bandpass for Python is significantly wider and although this alone wouldn't shift spectra, it's possible when this is combined with the hanning taper Python uses (and ML does not) it might create this marked disagreement in spectral averages for stations.\n",
    "    \t\t1. There is a much deeper dive needed to confirm and quantify the significant disagreements shown in how spectra are pre-processed and averaged differently between the two codes.\n",
    "    \t\t2. That said, the final product of corrected event traces seem largely in agreement with each other to an extent I question whether I understand this spectra disagreement issue correctly or overestimate its effect on the ATaCR method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. --------------In final product comparisons--------------\n",
    "    \t1. The corrected event traces seem nearly identical in nearly all cases looked at so far.\n",
