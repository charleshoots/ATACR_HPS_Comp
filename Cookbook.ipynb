    "# Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`|1|` Both Python ATaCR download scripts contain an error in how the instrument response is removed from the pressure channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "`|2|` It is fixed by changing the two calls for it in the noise/download scripts to the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "`stp.remove_response(pre_filt=args.pre_filt,output='DEF',water_level=None)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`|3|` This change to the code produces pressure channel spectra now highly consistent with spectra from both OBSIC on reference stations of similar depths and published results (e.g. Fig. 4 in Janiszewski et al, 2019) aswell as fixes the irregular behaviors originally shown in the admittance and phase plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. At some point, the instrument response should be moved from the download scripts to the start of the day-spectra script. It would help alot with QC/QA on these intermediate processing steps of ATaCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. It's out of the scope of my own concerns, but its atleast worth pointing out that the behavior in pressure spectra examined here may also be present in the Python ATaCR's docs pages (link: https://nfsi-canada.github.io/OBStools/atacr.html#tutorial). There, you see the same behavior in pressure spectra for M08A as described here. M08A's pressure channel is also a DPG.\n",
